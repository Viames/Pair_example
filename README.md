This base project allows a fast start to develop small to medium PHP applications like CRM or web-portals.
With the addition of a few files more, here provided as sample, and an initial database structure, your web project will be up and running in a breeze.

## Features
This basic project manages users authentication, creates new custom ActiveRecord classes and [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) modules starting from a DB table by a magic module named `developer`, all thru a friendly route logic.
Also it acts as REST API server.

## Quick start

### Installation

Choose a name for your new project and create a new folder where to install Pair_example:

```bash
$ mkdir project_name
$ cd project_name
```
Now you can create a new project [manually](#manual-installation) or by using [Composer](#composer).

#### <a name="manual-installation">Manual installation</a>

1. Please download the [Pair_example](https://github.com/Viames/Pair_example/releases)â€™s latest available release;
2. Unzip the content into your project folder;
3. Run your browser at web-server root and add the sub-url as configured in `BASE_URI` constant of config.php.

#### <a name="composer">Composer</a>

You can ask Composer to create the project into your new folder. If you donâ€™t have Composer installed in your system, please [download it](https://getcomposer.org/).

Launch a command-line terminal and create a new composer project named `project_name`:

```bash
$ composer create-project viames/pair_example project_name
```

### Configuration

Please open the config.php file in the root of the project, you will see a bunch of lines that can be customized according to your installation.

```PHP
<?php

// product
define ('PRODUCT_VERSION', '1.0');
define ('PRODUCT_NAME', 'Pair example');
define ('BASE_URI', '/pair_example'); // application URL subpath

// database
define ('DB_HOST', 'db_host');
define ('DB_NAME', 'db_name');
define ('DB_USER', 'db_user');
define ('DB_PASS', 'db_pass');
```

By creating different versions of this file you can move the project on different web-servers. This is useful for running a development version, a test version and a production version of the same project.

Now itâ€™s time to login using `admin` as username and password too. Maybe you agree to change this one as soon as you login ðŸ˜Œ
